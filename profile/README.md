CROSSMARK is a browser extension wallet built for interacting with the XRP Ledger. CROSSMARK adds to an already diverse network of wallets and provides tooling for developers building decentralized applications on sidechains. The wallet will provide an easy way to switch between custom networks and will help bridge communities and cross-chain features.

Whirledlabs has three main goals with CROSSMARK and hopes to solve some of the current points of friction in the XRP ecosystem

- Provide an alternative to a mobile-first wallet to specifically serve webapps that are more suited for browser environments
- Define and adopt a universal QR code structure for other wallets and builders for the XRP Ledger 
- Provide a wallet that supports custom networks, network specific features, and hot swapping between networks. Our browser wallet will be architected with future features in mind, such as AMM and sidechain proposals.

Since no browser-first wallet has been developed for the XRP Ledger, and the already existing browser wallets are not directly supported, the XRP community has been interacting with the ledger through a mobile-first wallet. Looking at different ecosystems, it is clear that some applications cannot and will not support mobile. Mobile screens are too small for sophisticated financial products and dashboards. For a more diverse ecosystem of developer solutions, CROSSMARK will provide a direct way for user that are already on a computer, to sign in with a wallet (secure, encrypted keychain) that is stored on their computer/browser.

Whirledlabs has been a longtime supporter of the XRP Ledger for its speed, efficiency, and decentralization. CROSSMARK will be built on the XRP Ledger for these unique characteristic and will fill a void within the ecosystem. CROSSMARK will provide a unique utility to an already efficient ledger that will, one day, offer sophisticated financial operations, demanding secure and quick interactions.
