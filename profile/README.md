CROSSMARK is a browser extension wallet built for interacting with the XRP Ledger. CROSSMARK adds to an already diverse network of wallets and provides tooling for developers building decentralized applications on sidechains. The wallet will provide an easy way to switch between custom networks and will help bridge communities and cross-chain features.

Whirledlabs has three main goals with CROSSMARK and hopes to solve some of the current points of friction in the XRP ecosystem

- Provide an alternative to a mobile-first wallet to specifically serve webapps that are more suited for browser environments
- Define and adopt a universal QR code structure for other wallets and builders for the XRP Ledger 
- Provide a wallet that supports custom networks, network specific features, and hot swapping between networks. Our browser wallet will be architected with future features in mind, such as AMM and sidechain proposals.
